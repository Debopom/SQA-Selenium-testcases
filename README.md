Here OrangeHRM is tested using Selenium automation. The purpose is to thoroughly evaluate OrangeHRM to verify each feature's appropriate and secure functionality and improved user experience. 
All the tests are done by Selenium webdriver python scripts. 
OrangeHRM was hosted in a local server using XAMMP (http://localhost/OrangeHRM/)
The scripts are named after test modules.
After running each script, the output was observed accordingly and then the report was prepared.
